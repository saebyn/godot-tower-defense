# Multiple Spawn Areas Implementation Summary

## Overview

This implementation adds support for spawning enemies from multiple areas in a level, enabling more dynamic and strategic gameplay.

## What Changed

### Core Changes

1. **enemy_spawner.gd**
   - Changed export variable from single `spawn_area` to array `spawn_areas`
   - Updated `find_random_spawn_position()` to randomly select from multiple spawn areas
   - Added backward compatibility for existing single spawn area setups
   - Fixed coordinate transformation from local to global space

2. **enemy_spawner.tscn**
   - Updated to use the new array-based `spawn_areas` export
   - Template now uses `spawn_areas = [NodePath("MeshInstance3D")]`

### Documentation Added

1. **docs/multiple_spawn_areas.md** - Technical documentation
2. **docs/example_multiple_spawn_areas.md** - Usage examples and tutorials

## How It Works

### Single Spawn Area (Backward Compatible)

```
Level
└── EnemySpawner (positioned at -34, 1, 30)
    └── MeshInstance3D (default spawn area)
```

The spawner will use the single spawn area as before.

### Multiple Spawn Areas (New Feature)

```
Level
└── EnemySpawner
    ├── NorthSpawnArea (MeshInstance3D at -30, 1, -20)
    ├── SouthSpawnArea (MeshInstance3D at -30, 1, 20)
    └── EastSpawnArea (MeshInstance3D at 20, 1, 0)
```

When configured with multiple spawn areas:
1. Each enemy spawn randomly selects one of the areas
2. A random position is calculated within that area's bounds
3. The position is transformed to global coordinates
4. The enemy is spawned at that location

## Benefits

- **Varied Gameplay**: Enemies approach from multiple directions
- **Strategic Depth**: Players must defend multiple fronts
- **Level Design Flexibility**: Easy to create complex spawn patterns
- **Performance**: Efficient random selection with no performance overhead
- **Backward Compatible**: Existing levels continue to work without changes

## Usage Example

To configure multiple spawn areas in a level:

1. Add MeshInstance3D nodes as children of EnemySpawner
2. Position them at different locations in your level
3. In the EnemySpawner inspector, add them to the `spawn_areas` array
4. Run the level - enemies will spawn from random areas

See `docs/example_multiple_spawn_areas.md` for detailed examples.

## Technical Details

- **Random Selection**: Uses GDScript's `pick_random()` for O(1) area selection
- **Coordinate System**: AABB bounds are in local space, transformed to global
- **Compatibility**: Falls back to finding MeshInstance3D children if array is empty
- **Error Handling**: Logs error if no spawn areas are configured

## Testing

The implementation:
- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility with existing levels
- ✅ Properly transforms coordinates from local to global space
- ✅ Randomly distributes enemies across all configured spawn areas
- ✅ Handles edge cases (empty array, single area, multiple areas)

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements:
- Weighted spawn area selection (some areas spawn more frequently)
- Spawn area activation based on game state or wave number
- Visual indicators for spawn areas in the editor
- Per-wave spawn area configuration
