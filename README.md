</div>

A lighthearted zombie tower defense game with a click-to-kill twist, built with Godot 4.

> 🧟‍♂️ Defend helpless survivors from waves of zombies using nothing but your mouse and some scrap-built defenses. Click zombies for scrap, build automated turrets, and make permanent tech tree choices that shape your playstyle.

## 🎮 What Is This?

**Zom Nom Defense** is a lo-fi, chaotic tower defense/clicker hybrid where:
- You **click zombies** to deal manual damage and earn "scrap"
- You spend scrap to **place obstacles and turrets** to automate defense
- You **defend absurd scenarios** (person on a car, survivor in a hammock, inflatable pool party)
- You **unlock tech via achievements** and level up through an XP system
- You make **permanent strategic choices** in a branching tech tree (choose Rapid Fire OR Heavy Damage - forever!)

**Genre**: Tower Defense / Clicker Hybrid  
**Platform**: PC (Steam planned)  
**Tone**: Silly but strategic - light-hearted post-apocalypse chaos
