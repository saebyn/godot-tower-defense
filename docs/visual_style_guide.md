# Zom Nom Defense - Visual Style Guide

**Last Updated**: October 25, 2025  
**Status**: Draft - To be refined during Phase 6 visual polish pass

---

## Visual Direction

### Core Aesthetic: Modern Lo-Fi

**Definition**: Stylized, low-polygon 3D art with simple textures that emphasize readability, charm, and efficiency over realism.

**NOT**: Retro/blocky Minecraft-style, PS1-era jaggy polygons, or pixel art aesthetic  
**YES**: Modern indie game style - smooth organic forms with reduced detail (Firewatch, A Short Hike, Sable)

### Key Principles

1. **Readable** - Easy to identify enemies, towers, and game elements at a glance
2. **Charming** - Inviting and comedic, not scary or gross
3. **Efficient** - Quick to create assets, good performance
4. **Cohesive** - Consistent style across all elements
5. **Timeless** - Won't look dated in 5 years

## Technical Specifications

### Polygon Counts

| Asset Type | Target Poly Count | Notes |
|------------|-------------------|-------|
| **Characters** (zombies, survivors) | 500-2000 | Focus on silhouette clarity |
| **Small props** (weapons, items) | 100-500 | Simple recognizable shapes |
| **Medium props** (campfire, trees) | 200-1000 | Organic but simplified |
| **Large props** (pool, structures) | 500-2000 | Balance detail vs performance |
| **Terrain tiles** | 50-200 | Kept very simple for performance |

### Textures

- **Resolution**: 512x512 to 1024x1024 maximum
- **Style**: Hand-painted, gradient, or solid colors
- **Detail Level**: Simple, no fine details like individual stitches or scratches
- **Maps**: Diffuse + optional AO, minimal normal maps
- **Format**: PNG for transparency needs, otherwise compressed formats

### Materials & Shaders

- Simple shaders (toon, cel-shaded, or custom painterly)
- Flat or simple gradient lighting
- Soft shadows
- No PBR materials (no metallic/roughness complexity)
- Consistent rim lighting for readability

## Character Design

### Zombies

**Style**: 
- Humanoid, slightly hunched posture
- Smooth low-poly forms (not blocky)
- Proportions can be slightly exaggerated for comedy

**Proportions**:
- Normal to slightly-larger heads for expressiveness
- Limbs can be slightly elongated for shambling effect
- Distinct silhouettes for each type

**Features**:
- Clear zombie characteristics (posture, color, movement) without gore
- Simple facial features (sunken eyes, slack jaw)
- Torn clothing suggested by texture, not geometry

**Animation Notes**:
- Shambling, lurching movement
- Simple but distinctive walk cycles per type
- Death animations: simple ragdoll or fade out

### Survivors

**Style**:
- More upright, alert posture
- Normal proportions for contrast with zombies
- Expressive and animated

**Clothing**:
- Simple, recognizable (solid color shirts/pants)
- 2-3 color outfit maximum
- Minimal geometric detail

**Animations**:
- Reactive and comedic (wobble, jump, panic)
- Idle animations showing personality
- Looking toward nearest zombie

---

## Environment Design

### Props

**Natural Elements**:
- Trees: Trunk + foliage clumps (not individual leaves)
- Rocks: Smooth, rounded forms
- Water: Simple plane with animated shader

**Man-Made Elements**:
- Campfire: Simple logs + flame geometry + particles
- Pool: Blue plane + white edge rim
- Hammock: Simple mesh between poles
- Boxes/Crates: Rounded cube forms

**Design Principles**:
- **Recognizable at a glance** - clear what each prop is
- **Simplified geometry** - reduce polys while keeping shape
- **Painterly textures** over photorealism
- **Support comedic absurdity** (oversized pool floaties, etc.)

### Terrain

- Painted/stylized ground textures (not photo-based)
- Simple height variations (hills, valleys)
- Grid faintly visible for placement clarity
- Clear walkable vs non-walkable areas
- Minimal texture tiling artifacts

---

## UI Style

### Visual Language

- Clean, modern interface
- Consistent with 3D art style
- Simple geometric shapes (rounded rectangles, circles)
- Flat or subtle gradients
- Clear visual hierarchy

### Typography

- Clean sans-serif font
- High contrast with background
- Large enough for readability
- Consistent sizing system

### Icons

- Simple, clear silhouettes
- Match art style (not photorealistic)
- Consistent stroke weight
- Recognizable at small sizes

### Feedback

- Simple particle effects
- Screen shake for impact
- Color flashes for state changes
- Sound + visual confirmation for actions

---

## Effects & Particles

### Visual Effects

**Particle Systems**:
- Simple geometric shapes (spheres, cubes, planes)
- Short lifetimes (0.5-2 seconds)
- Clear purpose (muzzle flash, impact, death)

**Examples**:
- **Turret Fire**: Small yellow spheres + brief flash
- **Zombie Death**: Green puff particles + fade out
- **Impact**: White flash + small debris
- **Scrap Pickup**: Coins floating up with trail

**Guidelines**:
- Understated, not overwhelming
- Match color palette
- Don't obscure gameplay
- Performance-friendly (low particle counts)

---

## Reference Games

### Primary Inspiration

1. **Firewatch** - Painterly textures, stylized nature
2. **A Short Hike** - Charming low-poly, inviting atmosphere
3. **Sable** - Comic book aesthetic, clean lines
4. **Dorfromantik** - Toy-like, clean, satisfying to look at
5. **Kentucky Route Zero** - Simple geometry, atmospheric

### What We're NOT Going For

❌ **Minecraft** - Too blocky/cubic  
❌ **SUPERHOT** - Too abstract/minimal  
❌ **Obra Dinn** - Too retro/1-bit  
❌ **Realistic/AAA** - Too detailed/complex  
❌ **Pixel Art** - Different medium entirely

---

## Implementation Workflow

### Modeling Process

1. **Concept/Sketch** - Define basic shapes and proportions
2. **Block Out** in Blender with primitives
3. **Refine** with subdivision surfaces (level 1-2 max)
4. **Optimize** topology for smooth curves with low poly count
5. **UV Unwrap** with simple, efficient layouts
6. **Export** with proper normals and scaling

### Texturing Process

1. **UV Layout** - Keep it simple and organized
2. **Base Colors** - Block in main color areas
3. **Add Detail** - Subtle shading, edge highlights
4. **AO Pass** (optional) - Bake from high-poly if needed
5. **Test** in-game at camera distance
6. **Iterate** based on readability

### Shader Setup (Godot)

```gdscript
# Example toon shader setup
shader_type spatial;
render_mode unshaded; // or use simple shading

uniform sampler2D texture_albedo : hint_albedo;
uniform vec4 albedo_tint : hint_color = vec4(1.0);
uniform float rim_amount : hint_range(0.0, 1.0) = 0.5;
uniform vec4 rim_color : hint_color = vec4(1.0);

// Simple toon shading with rim light
void fragment() {
    vec4 tex = texture(texture_albedo, UV);
    ALBEDO = tex.rgb * albedo_tint.rgb;
}

void light() {
    // Simplified toon lighting
    float NdotL = dot(NORMAL, LIGHT);
    float toon = step(0.5, NdotL);
    DIFFUSE_LIGHT += ALBEDO * toon * ATTENUATION;
}
```

### Testing Checklist

## Iteration & Feedback

### Prototype First

- Start with placeholder geometry
- Test in gameplay context
- Get feedback early
- Refine based on actual needs

### Review Process

1. Create asset following style guide
2. Test in game at proper camera angle
3. Check against style references
4. Get team feedback (if applicable)
5. Iterate if needed
6. Document any style guide updates

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ Too much detail - remember, simple is better  
❌ Inconsistent poly counts - keep similar assets similar  
❌ Texture resolution too high - wastes memory  
❌ Over-complicated UV layouts - keep it simple  
❌ Forgetting to test at game camera distance  
❌ Making assets that don't read clearly in gameplay
