## Features Implemented

### Core Functionality
- ✅ **Tech Tree Loading**: Automatically loads all .tres files from Config/TechTree/
- ✅ **Unlock Validation**: Checks level, scrap, prerequisites, and locked status
- ✅ **Mutual Exclusivity**: Locks alternative tech paths when choice is made
- ✅ **Branch Completion**: Tracks completion status for branch-gated techs
- ✅ **Signal System**: Emits tech_unlocked and tech_locked signals
- ✅ **Logger Integration**: All operations logged with appropriate levels

### TechNodeResource Fields
```gdscript
- id: String                              # Unique identifier
- display_name: String                    # UI display name

```

### TechTreeManager API

#### Core Methods
- `can_unlock_tech(tech_id: String) -> bool` - Validates unlock requirements
- `unlock_tech(tech_id: String) -> bool` - Unlocks tech with validation
- `is_tech_unlocked(tech_id: String) -> bool` - Check unlock status
- `is_tech_locked(tech_id: String) -> bool` - Check lock status
- `get_tech_node(tech_id: String) -> TechNodeResource` - Retrieve tech resource

#### Helper Methods
- `get_techs_in_branch(branch_name: String) -> Array[TechNodeResource]` - Filter by branch
- `is_branch_completed(branch_name: String) -> bool` - Check branch completion
- `get_unlocked_obstacle_ids() -> Array[String]` - Get all unlocked obstacles
- `reset_tech_tree() -> void` - Reset for testing/new game

#### Signals
- `tech_unlocked(tech_id: String)` - Emitted when tech is unlocked
- `tech_locked(tech_id: String)` - Emitted when tech is locked (mutual exclusivity)

## Validation & Testing

### Unit Tests (18 tests, 100% passing)
- ✅ Tech tree loading from resources
- ✅ Level requirement validation
- ✅ Prerequisite checking
- ✅ Mutual exclusivity locking
- ✅ Permanently locked tech handling
- ✅ Signal emission verification
- ✅ Branch completion tracking
- ✅ Obstacle ID accumulation
- ✅ State reset functionality

### Test Results
```
Scripts:  4
Tests:    31 (18 TechTreeManager + 5 Logger + 6 CurrencyManager + 2 Integration)
Passing:  31
Asserts:  51
Time:     0.019s
Status:   All tests passed ✅
```

### Manual Verification
- ✅ Godot 4.4 asset import successful
- ✅ Script class registration working
- ✅ Autoload initialization working
- ✅ Tech nodes loading correctly
- ✅ CurrencyManager integration working
- ✅ Logger integration working

## Integration Points

### Current Integrations
1. **CurrencyManager** - For level and scrap checks
   - `CurrencyManager.get_level()` - Player level validation
   - `CurrencyManager.get_scrap()` - Scrap cost validation
   - `CurrencyManager.spend_scrap()` - Scrap deduction

2. **Logger** - Comprehensive logging
   - DEBUG: Validation failures, requirement checks
   - INFO: Tech unlocks, locks, initialization, resets
   - WARN: Invalid operations, missing resources
   - ERROR: Critical failures

### Future Integration Points
1. **AchievementManager** (when implemented)
   - Check `achievement_ids` requirements
   - Currently commented out with TODO

2. **ObstacleRegistry** (for future feature)
   - Use `get_unlocked_obstacle_ids()` to filter available obstacles
   - Dynamic obstacle availability based on tech tree

3. **UI System** (for future feature)
   - Listen to `tech_unlocked` and `tech_locked` signals
   - Display tech tree state
   - Show unlock requirements

## Design Decisions

### 1. Tech Unlocking is Free
- No scrap cost for unlocking techs (per design doc)
- `scrap_cost` field exists but is unused (set to 0)
- Scrap is spent during gameplay to place obstacles, not for tech unlocking

### 2. Mutual Exclusivity Implementation
- Unlocking one tech adds alternatives to `locked_tech_ids`
- Locked techs cannot be unlocked (permanent choice)
- Supports replayability with different tech paths

### 3. Branch Completion
- A branch is completed when all non-locked techs are unlocked
- Mutually exclusive alternatives don't block completion
- Required for Advanced tier techs (per design doc)

### 4. Resource-Based Configuration
- All tech nodes stored as .tres resource files
- Easy to edit in Godot editor
- No code changes needed for new techs or balance adjustments

### 5. Logger Integration
- All operations logged with appropriate scope: "TechTreeManager"
- Helps with debugging and gameplay flow understanding
- Different log levels for different severity

## Example Usage

### In Code
```gdscript
# Check if a tech can be unlocked
if TechTreeManager.can_unlock_tech("tur_scrap_shooter"):
  # Unlock the tech
  if TechTreeManager.unlock_tech("tur_scrap_shooter"):
    print("Tech unlocked!")

# Listen for tech unlocks
func _ready():
  TechTreeManager.tech_unlocked.connect(_on_tech_unlocked)

func _on_tech_unlocked(tech_id: String):
  print("Tech unlocked: ", tech_id)
  # Update UI, enable obstacles, etc.

# Get all unlocked obstacles
var obstacle_ids = TechTreeManager.get_unlocked_obstacle_ids()
for obstacle_id in obstacle_ids:
  # Make obstacle available for placement
  pass
```

### Creating New Tech Nodes
1. Create new .tres file in Config/TechTree/
2. Set script to `tech_node_resource.gd`
3. Fill in all required fields
4. Tech automatically loaded on next game start

## Known Limitations

1. **Achievement Integration**: Commented out, waiting for AchievementManager implementation
2. **Persistence**: Tech tree state not yet persisted (requires save system)
3. **UI**: No visual tech tree UI yet (planned for future)

## Next Steps

As referenced in the issue dependencies:

### Blockers Resolved
✅ Issue #115 - Tech tree structure design (used as reference)
✅ Issue #114 - Player progression persistence (CurrencyManager.get_level() works)

### Blocked Issues (Now Unblocked)
- Issue #117 - Obstacle unlocks (can now use `get_unlocked_obstacle_ids()`)
- Issue #125 - Tech tree editor plugin (can extend TechNodeResource)

### Recommended Next Steps
1. **Save/Load System**: Persist `unlocked_tech_ids` and `locked_tech_ids`
2. **UI Implementation**: Visual tech tree with unlock/lock indicators
3. **Achievement Integration**: Hook up achievement checks when system is ready
4. **Content Creation**: Add remaining 20 tech nodes per design doc

## Acceptance Criteria Status
