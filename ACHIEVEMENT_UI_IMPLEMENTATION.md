    - Tests stats display
    - Tests card creation

## How to Test

### Manual Testing

1. **Test Achievement Notifications:**
   - Start the game
   - Trigger an achievement unlock (e.g., defeat first enemy for "First Blood")
   - Verify toast notification slides in from top-right
   - Verify notification displays correct name, description, and icon
   - Verify notification auto-hides after 5 seconds
   - Verify sound plays on unlock
   - Trigger multiple achievements quickly to test queueing

2. **Test Achievement List from Main Menu:**
   - From main menu, click "ACHIEVEMENTS" button
   - Verify achievement list opens showing all achievements
   - Verify unlocked achievements show unlock date
   - Verify locked achievements show progress percentage
   - Verify hidden achievements show "???" until unlocked
   - Verify achievements are sorted (unlocked first)
   - Verify stats label shows correct unlock count
   - Click "Close" button to close the list

3. **Test Achievement List from Pause Menu:**
   - Start a game
   - Press ESC to pause
   - Click "Achievements" button
   - Verify achievement list opens correctly
   - Verify all same functionality as main menu
   - Close and verify game remains paused

### Automated Testing

Run the unit tests:
```bash
./run_tests.sh
```

This will run the GUT test suite including the new achievement UI tests.

## Features Implemented

✅ Toast notification component with animations
✅ Auto-hide after 5 seconds
✅ Notification queue for simultaneous unlocks
✅ Achievement unlock sound effect
✅ Full achievement list UI with:
  - Scrollable list of all achievements
  - Individual achievement cards
  - Icon display
  - Progress tracking for locked achievements
  - Unlock date for unlocked achievements
  - Hidden achievement support
  - Unlock statistics
✅ Integration with main menu
✅ Integration with pause menu

## Notes

- The achievement unlock sound currently uses a placeholder sound effect. A proper achievement unlock sound should be added to `Assets/Audio/SFX/` and configured in AudioManager.
- The notification animation uses Godot's Tween system for smooth slide-in/slide-out effects.
- The notification manager is added as a CanvasLayer to ensure notifications appear on top of all other UI.
- Hidden achievements are properly masked until unlocked.
- The achievement list properly handles achievements with and without icons.

## Architecture

The implementation follows the project's existing patterns:
- UI components in appropriate directories (Common/UI for reusable, Stages/UI for screens)
- Signal-based communication with AchievementManager
- Proper cleanup and queue_free() usage
- GutTest-based unit tests
- Logger usage for debugging
- Integration with existing autoload systems (AchievementManager, AudioManager)
