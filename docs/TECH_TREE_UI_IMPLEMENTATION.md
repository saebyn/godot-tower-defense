# Tech Tree UI Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a complete Tech Tree UI screen that integrates with the TechTreeManager system to provide visual tech tree navigation and unlocking functionality.

## Components Created

### 1. Tech Tree Main Screen (`Stages/UI/tech_tree/tech_tree.tscn` / `.gd`)
- **240 lines** of GDScript code
- **108 lines** of scene definition
- Full-featured tech tree display with:
  - Tech nodes organized by branch (Offensive, Defensive, Economy, Support, Click, Advanced)
  - Real-time updates via TechTreeManager signals
  - Detail panel for selected tech nodes
  - Unlock button with state management
  - Confirmation dialog for mutually exclusive choices

### 2. Tech Node Card Component (`Stages/UI/tech_tree/tech_node_card.tscn` / `.gd`)
- **68 lines** of GDScript code
- **34 lines** of scene definition
- Visual representation of tech nodes with 4 states:
  - âœ… **Unlocked** (green) - tech is unlocked
  - âš¡ **Available** (yellow) - can be unlocked now
  - ðŸ”’ **Locked** (gray) - locked but not permanently
  - â›” **Permanently Locked** (red) - locked by exclusive choice

### 3. Navigation Integration
- **Pause Menu**: Added "Tech Tree" button between Resume and Settings
- **Main Menu**: Added "TECH TREE" button between Level Select and Settings
- Both menus handle instantiation and cleanup of tech tree UI

## Technical Implementation Details

### Signal Connections
```gdscript
TechTreeManager.tech_unlocked.connect(_on_tech_unlocked)
TechTreeManager.tech_locked.connect(_on_tech_locked)
```

### State Management
- Uses `selected_tech_id` to track current selection
- Maintains `tech_node_cards` dictionary for quick card updates
- Updates detail panel automatically on selection change

### Branch Organization
Tech nodes are grouped and displayed by branch:
1. Offensive (damage-dealing turrets/traps)
2. Defensive (walls, obstacles, debuffs)
3. Economy (scrap generation)
4. Support (buffs, repairs, synergy)
5. Click (player manual damage)
6. Advanced (requires branch completion)

### Exclusive Choice Warning
```gdscript
func _show_exclusive_warning(tech: TechNodeResource) -> void:
  var locked_names = []
  for exclusive_id in tech.mutually_exclusive_with:
    locked_names.append(TechTreeManager.tech_nodes[exclusive_id].display_name)
  
  var message = "Unlocking '%s' will permanently lock:\n\n" % tech.display_name
  for name in locked_names:
    message += "  â€¢ %s\n" % name
  message += "\nThis cannot be undone. Continue?"
  
  confirmation_dialog.dialog_text = message
  confirmation_dialog.popup_centered()
```

## Testing

### Unit Tests Created
- `tests/unit/test_tech_tree_ui.gd` - 130+ lines
- 12 test cases covering:
  - Initialization and scene loading
  - Tech node card creation and display
  - Selection and detail panel display
  - Unlock button state management
  - Signal-based UI updates
  - Branch organization
  - Close signal emission

### Manual Testing Guide
- `docs/TECH_TREE_UI_TESTING.md` - Comprehensive manual testing guide
- 10 test scenarios with acceptance criteria
- Covers all user interaction flows
- Includes instructions for testing exclusive choices

## Dependencies Satisfied
- âœ… Requires TechTreeManager (saebyn/zom-nom-defense#6) - Used extensively
- âœ… Requires tech tree structure (saebyn/zom-nom-defense#5) - All 25 tech nodes supported
- âœ… Uses ztd_ui_theme.tres - Applied to main scene

2. `Stages/UI/tech_tree/tech_tree.tscn` - Main UI scene
3. `Stages/UI/tech_tree/tech_tree.gd.uid` - Godot UID
4. `Stages/UI/tech_tree/tech_node_card.gd` - Card component logic
5. `Stages/UI/tech_tree/tech_node_card.tscn` - Card component scene
6. `Stages/UI/tech_tree/tech_node_card.gd.uid` - Godot UID
7. `tests/unit/test_tech_tree_ui.gd` - Unit tests
8. `tests/unit/test_tech_tree_ui.gd.uid` - Godot UID
9. `docs/TECH_TREE_UI_TESTING.md` - Manual testing guide

### Modified Files
1. `Stages/UI/pause_menu/pause_menu.gd` - Added tech tree button handler
2. `Stages/UI/pause_menu/pause_menu.tscn` - Added tech tree button
3. `Stages/UI/main_menu/main_menu.gd` - Added tech tree button handler
4. `Stages/UI/main_menu/main_menu.tscn` - Added tech tree button

## Code Quality
- Follows GDScript style guide with 2-space indentation
- Clear function and variable naming
- Comprehensive docstrings
- Type hints throughout
- Signal-based architecture for loose coupling
- Proper error handling and logging
- Consistent with existing codebase patterns

## Next Steps (Not Implemented - Out of Scope)
- Icons for tech nodes (currently text-based)
- Visual tree connections/lines between nodes
- Animations for unlock effects
- Sound effects for unlocking
- Hover tooltips in addition to detail panel
- Search/filter functionality for large tech trees

## Known Limitations
- Asset import must complete before UI can be tested (15+ minutes first time)
- No graphical lines showing prerequisites (relies on text description)
- Grid layout instead of graph layout (simpler but less visual)
- No tech node icons (uses text labels)

## Performance Notes
- Efficient: Creates cards once and updates state via signals
- Minimal memory footprint (25 cards = ~25 nodes)
- No per-frame updates (event-driven only)
- Proper cleanup on close (queue_free)

## Acceptance Criteria Status
All acceptance criteria from the issue have been met:
- âœ… Created tech tree UI scene at specified path
- âœ… Display tech nodes as visual grid/tree
- âœ… Show all 4 node states with proper icons/colors
- âœ… Display comprehensive tech information on selection
- âœ… Implement unlock button with cost/requirements
- âœ… Show confirmation dialog for mutually exclusive choices
- âœ… Update UI in real-time via signals
- âœ… Add buttons to main menu and pause menu
- âœ… Use ztd_ui_theme.tres for styling

## Conclusion
The Tech Tree UI implementation is complete and ready for use. All required features have been implemented following the specifications in the issue. The implementation integrates seamlessly with the existing TechTreeManager system and provides a comprehensive user experience for tech tree navigation and unlocking.
